# Road-Accident-Analysis_PowerBI-Project
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of road accidents using data visualization techniques. Leveraging Power BI, I delved into datasets containing information on various factors contributing to accidents such as weather conditions, road types, vehicle types, and more. Through interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations, I  aim to identify patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with road accidents. My analysis not only provides valuable insights for stakeholders in transportation and urban planning but also serves as a foundation for implementing targeted interventions and safety measures to reduce the incidence of road accidents."
